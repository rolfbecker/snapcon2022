# Snap!Con 2022 Conference - HSRW EOLab Contributions 

The Earth Observation Lab [(EOLab)](https://wiki.eolab.de/) team at Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences [(HSRW)](http://www.hsrw.eu) is working on computer vision and object recognition for applications in environmental monitoring and conservation. In addition, the EOLab team is also involved in the field of STEM education (K12) by creating open teaching materials and conducting workshops with schools for this purpose.  

A new activity that we find very exciting and promising is teaching the basics of machine learning to young students by combining Snap! with neural network based object detectors running on backend servers. For our current development, we mainly use small but powerful NVIDIA Jetson Nano computers running DetectNet to identify objects in images or video streams.
