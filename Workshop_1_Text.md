## Significance and Relevance of the Topic

Artificial intelligence is a prevailing technology that poses opportunities and risks for society and the environment. Building knowledge and skills in schools is critical to enable students early on to master the technology in stead of being mastered, to demystify AI, to acquire critical reflection competencies, to assess the opportunities and limitations of AI for problem solving.
The usability of many AI toolkits continues to improve. Less and less expert knowledge is required to use them. 

This Simplification can be further advanced. We use SNAP! to communicate with object detectors based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the current setup we utilize to the object detection software DetectNet running on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded computer as backend server.

Snap! is used to take snapshots (still images) from the local user PC webcam. These pictures are transmitted to the DetectNet server. This backend object detector reports the bounding box, the object type, and the confidence level for each identified object on the image back to Snap! This information is overlaid with the still image in Snap! This object metadata can be used to control Snap! programs such as games.


## Rough Agenda for the Workshop

In this practial workshop we learn how to use convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detectors in SNAP! The reported object information can then be used for control in SNAP! programs such as games. 

The workshop is provided in a mixed format: on-site as well as remote! 

The object detector software DetectNet is running on NVIDIA Jetson Nano computers, which we will provide in a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The credentials to access the network will be shared to the registered participants.

Each NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer can currently serve only one user PC/laptop. Therefore, **we need to limit the number of connected user computers to 10**. We suggest working in groups of 2 with one computer so that 20 people can participate. 


** Explain how you will budget the time, including time for attendee interaction. There must be at most 15 minutes of 'front of the room' presentation, with at least 30 minutes of hands-on activities and at least 10 minutes at the end for discussion. The agenda should include details on how participants will be supported in the virtual mode.



- **Expected Audience:** State the target audience (e.g., high school teachers, those who teach CS1, research proposal authors, etc). Also, estimate the number of likely participants.

- **Participant Equipment Requirements:** What are the needs to fully participate in the workshop?
    - _Equipment Required._ Participants must have equipment during the workshop in order to achieve the learning outcomes.
    - _Equipment Recommended._ Participants are more likely to fully achieve the learning outcomes if they have equipment during the workshop.
    - _Equipment Optional._ Participants may learn more about the topic if they have equipment during the workshop, but having it is not required to achieve the learning outcomes.
    - _Equipment Not Required._ Having equipment during this workshop is not likely to help participants learn more about the topic.
    - The kind of equipment (hardware and software) participants need (if appropriate).

- **Other Critical Information**: Include any other notes that will facilitate assessment of the Workshop proposal.
