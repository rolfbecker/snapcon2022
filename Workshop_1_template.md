The agenda should include details on how participants will be supported in the virtual mode.

- **Expected Audience:** State the target audience (e.g., high school teachers, those who teach CS1, research proposal authors, etc). Also, estimate the number of likely participants.

    - _Equipment Not Required._ Having equipment during this workshop is not likely to help participants learn more about the topic.
